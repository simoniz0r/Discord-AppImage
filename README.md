AppImage builds for [Discord Stable](https://discordapp.com)

To use an AppImage, just download it, `chmod a+x` the AppImage file, then run it!

All dependencies for AppImages built here are downloaded from Debian's repos.  This means that all AppImages here should work on any distro with package versions newer than those used in the AppImage build.

[Download AppImages from the releases page](https://github.com/simoniz0r/Discord-AppImage/releases)
